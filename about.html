                        For me sweet are the memories of the school-days. Deep are the impressions
                        of school-life and unforgettable are the experiences in schooldays.
                        On occasions the whole chart of memorable moments in school-life
                        moves in front of my eyes.  My School life was very interesting.
                        The School was very near from my house. </p>
                    <p align="justify" class="para">I spent first ten years of my childhood in a small and beautiful village.
                        My mother enrolled my name in the village Primary School when I was six.
                        A school was a totally new concept for me. The name of my school was Nandanpur Primary School.
                        On its first day I was afraid.
                        There I learnt 'my first A.B.C. and began a joyful period in my life.</p>
                    <p align="justify" class="para"> I used to attend the school regularly. I was week in mathematics.After
                        hard tring and the help of my teacher i become very good and get the highest
                        marks. But now a days my school life is only memory.What I am today is
                        a personality cut out and shaped by my teachers in my schooldays. </p>

                        My university experiences thus far have been amazing. I have learned and experienced
                        so many new things in such a short period of time, and it has gone by so fast.
                        I am still discovering all the opportunities that university offers me.My University name was
                        American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB)

                    </p>
                    <p class="para">Learning a new language is challenging but it is very rewarding. The course load is intense,
                        so time management is key.Time has been flying by and itâ€™s hard to believe that we have been on campus for two months already.
                        Life at <b><abbr title="American International University-Bangladesh">AIUB</abbr> </b> is a great experience that I plan to make the most out of. </p>
